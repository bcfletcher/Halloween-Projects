the laser_detector_transmitter_screwmount Shapr 3d model 

This model is ended to work with the following from Amazon.

1) MECCANIXITY Fully Threaded Rod M5 x 400mm 0.8mm Thread Pitch 304 Stainless Steel Right Hand Threaded Rods Bar Studs 4 Pack
2) 50-Pack M5-0.8mm Stainless Steel Serrated Flange Hex Nuts, SAE Flange Collar Hex Nut, Bright Finish, Anti-Rust Industrial Fasteners

4) Coliao 5pcs Laser Sensor Module Non-Modulator Tube Laser Receiver Module with 5pcs KY-008 650nm Laser Transmitter Module
6) Zhengmy 8 Packs Threaded Spike Flood Light Ground Stake Metal Replacement Stakes for Solar Lights Outdoor LED with 8 Hex Screws for Gardens Yard Path Lawn 6.3 Inches(Black)


basically attached the spike a bottom, then screw down one nut, attached either a transmitter or detector housing, screw down another nut, then attached the ball. The ball is intedned to prevent impailing someone if the trip near a transmitter/detector.


the above are the laser transmitter and receiver posts I use with my Raspberry Pico. I couple the Pico with the below relay DaFuRui relay  module which attached to the laster detector. The SB Components board is connected to 4 animatronics from eithe home depot or spirit halloween. the DaFuRui is connect to do GPIO pins on the Pico.

1) DaFuRui 5v Relay Moduleï¼Œ8Pack 1 Channel Relay Module 5v Relays Board with Optocoupler Support High/Low Level Trigger for Arduino Relays (from Amazon)
2) Raspberry Pi Pico Relay Board from SB Components (https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/raspberry-pi-pico-relay-board)
